# Aweshome: Make Your Home Smart and Awesome
## About our App
Aweshome is a smart home application that can help users to remotely control devices at home. The device can minimize the occurrence of fire, theft, and other unwanted things in the user's home. The aim is to provide security and protection to three vulnerable categories namely the elderly, disabled, and children when at home alone. Its manufacture uses IoT implementation and combines it with chatbot as machine learning implementations to make it easier for users to remotely access the part of the house. The data obtained from the device with the help of sensors placed at home will be connected to an application through android development.

## Development Process
In developing this project, we consist of 3 parts including: cloud computing, machine learning, and mobile development.
### Cloud Computing Development
Several things that will be done are developing  API(s), integrating ML and applications into GCP, developing and maintaining the architecture so we could manage resources required by Machine Learning and the mobile application. For machine learning, we will utilize Google Cloud AI Platform to train and deploy the model.

### Machine Learning Development
Making chatbots starting from library installation, program creation, GUI, to testing the feasibility. This chatbot feature is an advantage of the system because users can carry out orders in just one click to control the house even remotely. Users can also monitor the house by asking questions in real time.

### Mobile Development
Perform the initial stages of manufacture to maintenance on the device and the application. The following are the steps: device design, flowchart design, making mockups, making prototypes, developing, testing, and maintenance to ensure between the device and the application runs well.

## Other Notes
Will be informed later.
